A VFX-Only actor remover for the GZDoom gameplay mod "Hideous Destructor". 

This addon removes various 'visual only' actors in Hideous Destructor, which otherwise cannot be disabled via normal GZDoom settings (they do not count as 'particles' for particle reduction). Many actors are always deleted, while those that are essential visual tells (blood, shield sparks, fire smoke) have been reduced to half.
